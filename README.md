# titanicHeroku
This is my code for deploying a Machine learning model on Heroku.
The model is used to find out who can survive the tragic Titanic crash incident from the data available on Kaggle.
I have built a very basic Flask application to create an UI but this project is not focussed on UI but on learning the basics of how to create an ML application.
