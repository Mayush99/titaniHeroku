# titanicHeroku
Problem: 
The model is used to find out who can survive the tragic Titanic crash incident from the data available on Kaggle.
Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”. The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes. Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.

This is my code for deploying a Machine learning model on Heroku through which I can provide input to an UI and ask for result.
I have built a very basic Flask application to create an UI but this project is not focussed on UI but on learning the basics of how to create an ML application.
